# Security Hardening and Logging Overview

## Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the essential procedures for securing various open ports and configuring event logging on vulnerable operating systems. I will continue to include hardening procedures for all operating systems and provide detailed notes associated with each.

## Key Areas Covered

- **Port Hardening:** Guidelines for securing commonly exposed ports to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Event Logging:** Recommendations for configuring event logs to improve security monitoring and detection capabilities.

## Important Concepts

1. **Process Creation Logging:** Essential for tracking and monitoring processes running on a system, with options for using Sysmon or built-in Security logs.
2. **Security Log Configuration:** Proper tuning of the Security log for effective system monitoring.
3. **PowerShell Logging:** Enabling Module and ScriptBlock logging to detect and respond to PowerShell abuse.
4. **Sysmon and Additional Logs:** Utilizing Sysmon events and other critical logs for comprehensive security oversight.
