# Frameworks

## NIST Hardening

- **NIST National Checklist Program (NCP)**: The NCP is a U.S. government repository of publicly available security checklists, providing detailed guidance on security configurations for operating systems and applications. These checklists conform to the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), allowing automated configuration checks by validated security products. [Visit the NCP Repository](https://ncp.nist.gov/repository) for more information.

## STIG Compliance

- **STIG Viewer**: A tool provided by the Department of Defense to view Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), which are essential for ensuring compliance with security standards. [Access the STIG Viewer](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/srg-stig-tools/).
